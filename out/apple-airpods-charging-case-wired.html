The sound of wind breeze, looking at the sky and finding an alluring shade of blue or listening to our favorite song that takes you away to that special place. In a world of instant gratification and being surrounded by pings and notifications, it’s hard to find that happiness in an electronic gadget. Then, along came the Apple AirPods. On the face of it, it’s a simple gadget where Apple just chopped the wires from its earphones and presented it to the world.</p><hr/><h2>Design</h2><p>The new airpods are aesthetically absolutely identical to their predecessors, which means they still look like a pair of EarPods sans their wires. If you think the dangling stalk fashion is daft, look elsewhere. One AirPod weighs just 4g, and it’s easy to forget you’re even wearing them. What has changed is the charging case. There’s a little LED light on the top that lights up orange for a few seconds to let you know it’s detecting charge, and then green when it’s fully juiced. While it’ll charge it faster with a Lightning cable, throwing the case onto a pad when your phone isn’t hogging it just feels more convenient.</p><hr/><h2>Making calls and using Siri</h2><p>Double tapping the AirPods activates Siri, as long as your phone has a web connection. You can then use Siri in the same way you would control the personal assistant on your phone. Shouting commands into, what to others looks like thin air, is unnerving though, and making calls while wearing AirPods is a similarly strange experience. Many of us have become accustomed to seeing other people talking to themselves before noticing their mouthpiece attached to earphones. At the wrong angle, AirPods seemingly vanish making it look like you&#x27;re actually talking to yourself.</p><hr/><h2>Battery life</h2><p>The improved battery life is likely due to the newer H1 chip inside, that, on top of helping with connecting to your source devices, also plays a key role in power management</p><hr/><h2>Good for phone calls</h2><p>The Apple AirPods microphone is better than you’d expect from an embedded mic system. These should be perfectly fine for casual phone calls, and can even get you through some brief conference calls.</p><hr/><h2>Our Verdict</h2><a href="https://amzn.to/2WaX07x" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GO FOR IT</a><h3>PROS</h3><ul><li>Ample bass</li><li>Low distortion</li><li>Improved battery life</li></ul><h3>CONS</h3><ul><li>Recessed mids</li><li>Long charging times</li><li>Prone to scratches</li></ul></article></section></main></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{}},"page":"/apple-airpods-charging-case-wired","query":{},"buildId":"B6vcQQR4tpCiuI6zY9O5h","nextExport":true,"autoExport":true,"isFallback":false}</script><script nomodule="" src="/_next/static/chunks/polyfills-11c8eba6a84e3fddec04.js"></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/main-37806cd99d37f773d8c4.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/webpack-e067438c4cf4ef2ef178.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/framework.9116e7bff2bfccdffa19.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/3ef630e34cd10ba68f9d468ac363ff81c534e1e9.7653ebe13e00b05799c9.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/71247caf95475e3ea7f9a0f8a30beb258b23d005.cbf720431ed8afbb4f01.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/pages/_app-98377cd2e81b696e75f3.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/pages/apple-airpods-charging-case-wired-e875a41d1cab59d0614b.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/B6vcQQR4tpCiuI6zY9O5h/_buildManifest.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/B6vcQQR4tpCiuI6zY9O5h/_ssgManifest.js" async=""></script></body></html>
